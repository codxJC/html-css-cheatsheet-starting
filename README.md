#### PROJECT SCOPE
This is my **Codecademy Challenge Project: _"Build Your Own Cheat Sheet_"**

The scope of the project was to test my Web Development skills using
HTML and CSS and not to create the ultimate Cheatsheet webpage.
This is not a project focused on the ideal design.
This is a project about structure and learning.
